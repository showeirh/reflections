1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   
    Git creats a /.git directory to store the project's metadata and objects database. The repository initially contains four subdirectories:
     /hooks - for output massages;
     /info - exclude list
     /objects - contains the objects database
     /refs - stores the heads and tags.
    three files:
     config - project-specific configyration options
     description - used by Git-web program
     HEAD  - the guy who will walk the walk

   Initializing Git gets it ready to track files.

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
   repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is an intermediate space that holds objects to be commited. The working directory resides the projects and the repository is where the database is archived.
