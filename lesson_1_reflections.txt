How could having easy access to the history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the ling term?

	Answer:
	For writing a program code, there are two  main objectives: correct semantic and efficiency. Once a right output is achieved, the following stage is mainly to optimize the program. Unlike semantic, optimization is the name of the game. 
	A learning programmer, examining the history of a project, could efficiently follow the tweaks made to the program and would develop an instrument for segments of codes.
    Also a programmer can easily find newly added materials in a database, say a library in a programming language.
